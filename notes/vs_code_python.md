# Using VS Code for Python

**VS Code** does not come with built-in support for `Python` (only for `JavaScript`, `TypeScript` and `Node.js`), but with the help of the official **Microsoft Python extension** and other useful extensions, **VS Code** can give an excellent coding experience for Python programmers.

## Extensions

The extensions are one of the key advantages of VS Code. The coding efficiency can be hugely increased if a series of good extensions are enabled.

Here we note down a list of extensions which has been tested useful for Python coding, and a list of extensions which looks helpful and could be tested in the future.

### Installed Extensions

All installed extensions can be listed in command line via the following command:

```bash
code --list-extensions
```

#### Python (ms-python.python)

This is the official extension pack for the `Python` language. It is very versatile and covers most frequently needed features for programming in Python, like virtual environment, data science etc.

### Extensions to test

There is a long list of Python extensions on the extension marketplace and some of them looks interesting for a trial.

#### Kite Python Autocomplete (kiteco.kite)

This extension requires the installation of the Kite Engine to work. Once set up, this extension will provide machine learning based autocompletion in coding, which is advertised as much higher suggestion accuracy.

#### Python Docstring Generator (njpwerner.autodocstring)

This extension helps auto generate the doc string scaffold after you press the *enter* key after the triple quotes *"""*. This feature may make the documentation task much easier.
